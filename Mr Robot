# Mr. Robot — TryHackMe (Medium) 🤖🧠🐧

Mr. Robot is a Medium box that rewards **reading hints**, **thinking before brute-forcing**,  
and trusting **classic enumeration** over fancy tooling.

If you rush, you miss flags.  
If you read carefully, the machine solves itself.

## Machine Overview 🖥️📌

Machine Name: Mr. Robot  
Target IP: 10.10.xxx.xxx  
Operating System: Linux  
Difficulty: Medium  

This machine focuses on:
- Web-first enumeration
- robots.txt abuse (yes, really)
- Wordlist analysis instead of blind brute force
- WordPress admin exploitation
- Privilege escalation via **SUID misuse**

Old-school mistakes. Timeless lessons.

## Initial Reconnaissance 🔍

Enumeration began with a basic TCP scan.

nmap -sC -sV 10.10.xxx.xxx

The results were intentionally underwhelming.

Observations:
- Host was alive
- Services were not clearly exposed
- Traditional scanning wasn’t giving answers

Hints suggested:
👉 SSH, HTTP, and HTTPS exist — but **web exploration comes first**.

---

## Web Enumeration (Port 80 / 443) 🌐🧐

Opening the website revealed a Mr. Robot–themed page with interactive hints.

One clue stood out immediately:

👉 **robots.txt**

Visiting robots.txt revealed two critical paths:

/fsocity.dic  
/key-1-of-3.txt  

Accessing `/key-1-of-3.txt` returned:

073403c8a58a1f80d943455fb30724b9  

This was **Key 1** — no decoding required.

✅ First flag obtained.

---

## Wordlist Analysis (fsocity.dic) 📚🧠

The file `fsocity.dic` contained a massive wordlist.

But a hint warned:
> *“There’s something fishy about this wordlist.”*

Analysis revealed:
- Thousands of duplicate entries
- Suitable as both **username and password** list

Conclusion:
👉 This is an **analysis problem**, not a brute-force one.

---

## Username Discovery 🔎

Using the wordlist for **targeted username fuzzing** against WordPress revealed:

👉 Valid username: **elliot**

This confirmed:
- WordPress backend
- Authentication as the next attack vector

---

## Credential Discovery via Web Enumeration 🔑

Brute force alone didn’t solve it.

Manual inspection of site pages revealed a **license page** containing Base64 text:

ZWxsaW90OkVSMjgtMDY1Mgo=

Decoding it produced:

elliot:ER28-0652  

These credentials worked.

👉 WordPress admin access achieved.

---

## Initial Foothold — WordPress RCE 💥

With admin access:
- A WordPress theme file was edited
- A PHP reverse shell was injected
- Page loaded → shell triggered

Result:
- Shell obtained as **daemon** user
- Initial foothold established

Clean and predictable.

---

## Lateral Movement — robot 🧑‍💻

Further enumeration revealed a directory owned by **robot** containing:
- key-2-of-3.txt
- A file containing an **MD5 hash**

The hash was cracked, revealing robot’s password.

SSH login as robot succeeded.

✅ Second flag retrieved.

---

## Privilege Escalation — SUID Abuse 🚀

Privilege enumeration revealed a critical misconfiguration:

👉 **nmap** had the SUID bit set.

Using GTFOBins:


nmap --interactive
!sh


Result:
- Root shell spawned without sudo

---

## Root Access 🏁👑

- Root privileges confirmed  
- Third and final flag retrieved  
- Machine fully compromised  

Mr. Robot completed.

---

## Key Takeaways 🧠📌

- Always check robots.txt  
- Wordlists are for analysis, not just brute force  
- Manual enumeration beats automation here  
- WordPress admin access almost always equals RCE  
- SUID binaries are high-value escalation targets  
- Hints exist for a reason — trust them

## Final Words ☕

Mr. Robot proves a classic truth:

> “If you read carefully, the system tells you how to hack it.”

No exploits.  
No races.  
Just enumeration done right.

Medium box.  
Iconic lessons.
