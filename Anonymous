# Anonymous — TryHackMe (Medium) 🎭🧠🐧

Anonymous is a Medium-level machine that proves one simple thing:

> **You don’t need a web app to get hacked.  
> Misconfigured services are more than enough.**

No HTTP.  
No CMS.  
Just anonymous access, writable scripts, and SUID doing SUID things.

---

## Machine Overview 🖥️📌

Machine Name: Anonymous  
Target IP: 10.10.xxx.xxx  
Operating System: Ubuntu-based Linux  

This machine focuses on:
- Abusing **anonymous services**
- Achieving execution through **writable FTP scripts**
- Escalating privileges via a **misconfigured SUID binary**

Pure service-based exploitation. Very realistic.

---

## Initial Reconnaissance 🔍

A full TCP scan was performed to understand the exposed services.

nmap -sC -sV 10.10.xxx.xxx

Services discovered:

21/tcp   FTP     vsFTPd (Anonymous login enabled, writable directory) 📂  
22/tcp   SSH     OpenSSH 7.6p1 🔐  
139/445  SMB     Samba (Guest access enabled, signing not required) 📁  

Notably:
- No HTTP service was present
- Entire attack surface was service-driven

This immediately shifted the mindset away from web exploitation.

---

## FTP Enumeration 📂🧠

Anonymous FTP login was enabled, allowing unrestricted access.

Inside the FTP share, a writable directory was found:

👉 **scripts**

Contents included:
- A cleanup shell script  
- A log file  
- A basic to-do file  

At first glance, nothing screamed “exploit”.

But boring files are often the most dangerous ones.

---

## Interpreting the Hint 🧩

The provided hint stated:

> *“What's that log file doing there?  
> nc won't work the way you'd expect it to.”*

This strongly suggested:
- Scripts were being executed automatically
- Manual netcat listeners alone wouldn’t help
- Some form of scheduled or background execution was in play

The attack shifted from **reading files** to **modifying them**.

---

## Script Abuse via FTP 🧨

The cleanup script was downloaded and reviewed locally.

Its logic indicated:
- Periodic execution
- Likely triggered by a scheduled task or service

Instead of attempting direct command execution, the script was modified to include a **reverse shell payload**.

Steps taken:
- Script edited locally
- Original script replaced via FTP upload

Now it was just a matter of waiting.

---

## Initial Foothold 🐾

Once the script executed automatically:

- Reverse shell received  
- User-level access obtained  
- user.txt flag retrieved  

This confirmed:
👉 The script was indeed executed by the system itself.

Persistence without persistence.

---

## Post-Exploitation Enumeration 🔎

With a stable shell, privilege escalation enumeration followed.

During enumeration, a binary with **SUID permissions** was discovered.

Specifically:
- An environment-related binary
- Executable with elevated privileges

SUID binaries like this are notoriously dangerous when misconfigured.

---

## Privilege Escalation 🚀

The SUID binary was cross-referenced with known techniques.

Using a standard **GTFOBins** method:
- Command execution as root was achieved

No kernel exploits.  
No brute force.  
Just trusted binaries doing untrusted things.

---

## Root Access 🏁👑

- Root privileges confirmed  
- root.txt flag retrieved  
- Full system compromise achieved  

Clean. Predictable. Effective.

---

## Key Takeaways 🧠📌

- Anonymous FTP + writable directories is a critical risk  
- Files don’t need to be malicious — execution makes them dangerous  
- Modifying files is often more powerful than reading them  
- SUID binaries remain one of the most reliable escalation vectors  
- Simple misconfigurations can fully compromise a system

## Final Words ☕

Anonymous teaches a quiet lesson:

> “If anyone can write, someone will execute.”

No web app.  
No noise.  
Just services trusting the wrong people.

Medium box.  
Very real-world misconfigurations.
