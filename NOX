# NOX — TryHackMe (Medium) 🧪🧠🌌

NOX is not about exploits.
It’s about **seeing patterns**, **reading clues**, and **thinking sideways**.

If you try to brute-force this box, it laughs.
If you reason through it, it opens up cleanly.

---

## Machine Overview 🖥️📌

Machine Name: NOX  
Target IP: 10.10.xxx.xxx  
Operating System: Linux  
Difficulty: Medium  

This machine emphasizes:
- **Logical reasoning over brute force**
- **Non-traditional enumeration**
- **Visual + encoding-based clues**
- Exploitation of **enterprise monitoring software (Nagios)**

Tools help — but **thinking wins**.

---

## Initial Reconnaissance 🔍

A full TCP scan was performed to understand the exposed services.

nmap -sC -sV 10.10.xxx.xxx

Services discovered:

22/tcp    SSH     OpenSSH 7.2p2 🔐  
25/tcp    SMTP    Postfix 📧  
80/tcp    HTTP    Apache 2.4.18 🌐  
389/tcp   LDAP    OpenLDAP 📚  
443/tcp   HTTPS   Apache (Nagios-related SSL cert) 🔒  

The presence of:
- LDAP
- SMTP
- Nagios-related SSL certificates

…strongly suggested an **enterprise-style monitoring environment**,  
not a basic web challenge.

---

## Web Enumeration 🌐🧐

Manual inspection of the website revealed a minimal landing page.

However, one thing immediately stood out:

- A **periodic table–like layout**
- Pairs of letters that didn’t look random

Given that this was a guided CTF, the visual clue was intentional.

This was not decoration.
This was data.

---

## Reasoning the Periodic Table Clue 🧠🧩

The symbols displayed were:

Ag – Hg – Ta – Sb – Po – Pd – Hg – Pt – Lr

Mapping each element to its **atomic number**:

- Ag = 47  
- Hg = 80  
- Ta = 73  
- Sb = 51  
- Po = 84  
- Pd = 46  
- Hg = 80  
- Pt = 78  
- Lr = 103  

Resulting numeric sequence:

47 80 73 51 84 46 80 78 103

Converting this sequence to ASCII produced:

👉 **PI3T.png**

This confirmed the existence of a hidden image file.

---

## Image Analysis 🖼️🔎

The image was downloaded and analyzed.

Using metadata inspection (exiftool), the **artist field** revealed meaningful information tied directly to the challenge flow.

This confirmed that:
- The attack path was **logic-driven**
- Traditional brute force was not intended

The image wasn’t just a picture.

---

## Source Code Recovery (Piet Programming) 🎨➡️💻

Further hints suggested the image was actually **Piet code**  
(an esoteric programming language where images *are* programs).

Using **npiet**, the image was converted into readable logic.

This revealed valid credentials:

Username: **nagiosadmin**  
Password: **n3p3UQ&9BjLp4$7uhWdY**

At this point, the box shifted from puzzle to exploitation.

---

## Nagios XI Exploitation 🚀

Using the recovered credentials:
- Access to the **Nagios XI dashboard** was obtained

Version enumeration confirmed:
- A known **Remote Code Execution vulnerability**

An existing exploit module was used to gain command execution.

Result:
- Remote shell obtained
- Service context provided elevated access

---

## Flag Retrieval 🏁

With command execution achieved:

- User flag retrieved  
- Root-level access confirmed via service context  
- Final flag obtained  

NOX fully compromised.

---

## Key Takeaways 🧠📌

- Enumeration is not always technical — **visual clues matter**
- Periodic table references were intentional, not decorative
- Encoding layers can exist outside standard cryptography
- Image files can contain executable logic
- Monitoring software like **Nagios** is a high-value target
- **Reasoning > brute force > tools**

## Final Words ☕

NOX teaches one rare lesson:

> “Not everything needs to be attacked.  
> Some things need to be understood.”

Patterns over payloads.  
Logic over noise.

Medium box.  
Excellent mental exercise.
