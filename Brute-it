# Brute It — TryHackMe (Easy) 🔐🧠⚔️

Brute It is exactly what the name promises.
No tricks. No hidden magic.

Just focused enumeration, credential abuse, and a classic sudo misconfiguration.
A perfect beginner-friendly machine that reinforces core fundamentals.

## Machine Overview 🖥️📌

Room Name: Brute It  
Target IP: 10.10.236.217  
Operating System: Linux  
Difficulty: Easy  

Focus Areas:
- Web enumeration
- Login brute forcing
- SSH key handling
- Sudo misconfiguration
- Practical use of GTFOBins

---

## Reconnaissance 🔍

Initial service enumeration was performed using Nmap.

nmap -sC -sV 10.10.236.217

Results:

- 22/tcp  SSH    OpenSSH 7.6p1  
- 80/tcp  HTTP   Apache httpd 2.4.29  

Only SSH and HTTP were exposed, indicating a small and focused attack surface.

---

## Web Enumeration 🌐

Visiting the website on port 80 showed the default Apache2 landing page.
No useful information was found in the page source.

Directory enumeration revealed an important endpoint:

/admin

This endpoint hosted a login panel.
Given the machine name “Brute It”, a brute-force attack was the intended path.

---

## Brute Forcing the Admin Panel 🔐

The login panel showed no rate limiting or protection.
Hydra was used to brute-force the credentials.

Command used:

hydra -l admin -P /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt \
http-post-form "/admin:username=^USER^&password=^PASS^:F=incorrect"

Credentials found:

Username: admin  
Password: xavier  

Admin access was successfully obtained.

---

## Admin Panel Enumeration 🗝️

After logging into the admin panel, an RSA private SSH key was discovered.
The key was password protected, so the next step was to crack the passphrase.

---

## Cracking the SSH Key Passphrase 🔓

The private key was cracked using John the Ripper.

Result:

Passphrase: rockinroll

With the passphrase recovered, the SSH key became usable.

---

## Initial Foothold (SSH) 🖥️

Using the cracked SSH key:

ssh -i id_rsa john@10.10.236.217

Login was successful.
Initial foothold achieved as user **john**.

---

## Privilege Escalation 🚀

Sudo permissions were checked:

sudo -l

Output revealed:

(ALL) NOPASSWD: /bin/cat

This means the user john could execute `cat` as root without a password.

---

## Privilege Escalation via GTFOBins 🧠

According to GTFOBins, `cat` can be abused to read sensitive files as root.

Root flag retrieved using:

sudo cat /root/root.txt

---

## Flags 🏁

User Flag: Retrieved after SSH access  
Root Flag: Retrieved via sudo misconfiguration  

Machine fully compromised.

---

## Summary ✅

- Discovered admin login panel through basic enumeration  
- Brute-forced credentials using Hydra  
- Extracted and cracked a password-protected SSH key  
- Gained SSH access as a low-privileged user  
- Escalated privileges using a sudo misconfiguration  

---

## Key Takeaways 🧠📌

- Enumeration matters more than exploits  
- Login panels without rate limiting are dangerous  
- SSH keys are only as strong as their passphrases  
- Sudo misconfigurations can instantly lead to root access  
- Understanding the machine’s context helps guide the attack path

## Final Words ☕

Brute It proves one simple lesson:

“You don’t need exploits  
when passwords and sudo are broken.”

Easy machine.  
Strong fundamentals.
