# 0day — TryHackMe (Medium) 🐢🌪️🧠

0day is a Medium box that blends **old-school web exploitation** with  
**kernel-level privilege escalation**.

Nothing fancy.  
Nothing modern.  
Just legacy tech quietly waiting to be abused.

---

## Machine Overview 🖥️📌

Machine Name: 0day  
Target IP: 10.10.xxx.xxx  
Operating System: Ubuntu-based Linux  

This machine focuses on:
- Gaining an **initial foothold via a classic web vulnerability**
- Recognizing the danger of an **outdated Linux kernel**
- Escalating privileges using a **kernel-level exploit**

The hint says it all:
> *“Exploit Ubuntu, like a turtle in a hurricane.”*

Slow, old, and absolutely helpless.

---

## Initial Reconnaissance 🔍

A full TCP scan was performed to understand the exposed surface.

nmap -sC -sV 10.10.xxx.xxx

Services discovered:

22/tcp   SSH    OpenSSH 6.6.1p1 🔐  
80/tcp   HTTP   Apache 2.4.7 🌐  

Additional observations:
- Page title: **0day**
- Linux kernel: **4.4**

That kernel version immediately stood out —  
Linux 4.4 is **ancient** and well-documented for local privilege escalation.

---

## Web Enumeration (Port 80) 🌐🧐

Initial web enumeration focused on identifying common entry points.

- Manual inspection revealed no obvious uploads or injections  
- Automated enumeration was used to locate hidden paths  

At this stage, the web app alone did not provide direct access.

However, the provided hint made one thing clear:

👉 **Web access is only the entry — kernel exploitation is the endgame.**

---

## Backup Artifact Discovery 📦🔑

Continued enumeration uncovered an exposed backup artifact.

Inside it:
- An **SSH private key**

The key was encrypted with a passphrase.

After identifying the key format and cracking the passphrase:

Passphrase recovered:
- **letmein**

However, authentication still failed —  
the **username was unknown**.

This meant the key alone was not enough.

---

## Identifying the Initial Foothold 🧠🎯

Instead of brute-forcing usernames, the attack surface was revisited.

Further inspection of the web server revealed a critical endpoint:

👉 **/cgi-bin/test.cgi**

This immediately raised alarms.

Legacy CGI + Apache + Ubuntu =  
**Shellshock candidate**.

---

## Exploitation via Shellshock 💥🐚

The CGI endpoint was confirmed vulnerable to **Shellshock**.

By crafting malicious HTTP headers:
- Arbitrary command execution was achieved
- A reverse shell was spawned

Result:
- Stable user-level shell obtained  
- Initial foothold confirmed  

At this point, the machine was compromised —  
but not yet owned.

---

## Post-Exploitation Enumeration 🔎

Once inside the system, enumeration confirmed:

- Ubuntu distribution with **Linux kernel 4.4**
- Kernel known to be vulnerable to multiple LPE exploits

This aligned perfectly with:
- The hint  
- The machine name  
- The overall design  

Everything pointed toward **kernel exploitation**.

---

## Privilege Escalation 🚀🧠

A privilege escalation exploit compatible with **Linux kernel 4.4** was selected.

The exploit was executed successfully.

Result:
- Root-level privileges obtained  
- System fully compromised  

No sudo abuse.  
No misconfigured scripts.  
Just an unpatched kernel doing what it does best.

---

## Root Access 🏁👑

- Root privileges confirmed  
- root.txt flag retrieved  
- Full system compromise achieved  

Mission complete.

---

## Key Takeaways 🧠📌

- Backup files often leak high-impact credentials  
- Encrypted keys are only as strong as their passphrases  
- Legacy CGI scripts still expose Shellshock in the wild  
- Old Linux kernels are privilege escalation goldmines  
- Timely patching would have stopped everything

## Final Words ☕

0day reinforces one harsh reality:

> “An unpatched kernel is already compromised.”

Classic web bug.  
Old kernel.  
Guaranteed root.

Medium box.  
Very real-world lesson.
