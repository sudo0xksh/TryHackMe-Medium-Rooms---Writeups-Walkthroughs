# Source — TryHackMe (Easy) 💻⚙️🔥

Source is a straight-up **service exploitation** box.
No chaining, no tricks — just **clean recon + correct exploit**.

If you miss version enumeration, you miss the box.
If you do it right, you’re root in minutes.

## Machine Overview 🖥️📌

Room Name: Source  
Target IP: 10.10.52.90  
Operating System: Linux  
Difficulty: Easy  

Primary focus:
- Service enumeration
- Version identification
- Exploit research
- Exploiting outdated admin panels (Webmin)

Very realistic real-world misconfiguration scenario.

---

## Reconnaissance 🔍

Initial enumeration was performed using Nmap.

nmap -sC -sV 10.10.52.90

yaml
Copy code

Results:

- 22/tcp     SSH      OpenSSH 7.6p1  
- 10000/tcp  HTTP     MiniServ 1.890 (Webmin)

Key observations:
- SSH is present but not the intended entry point
- Webmin exposed on port 10000
- Webmin is historically **high-risk if outdated**

This immediately shaped the attack path.

---

## Web Enumeration — Webmin (Port 10000) 🌐

Visiting port 10000 revealed a **Webmin login panel**.

Version identified:
MiniServ 1.890

yaml
Copy code

This version is known to be affected by a **critical unauthenticated Remote Code Execution vulnerability**.

At this point:
- No brute force required
- No credentials required
- Exploitation path confirmed

---

## Exploitation — Webmin RCE 💥

Public exploit research confirmed that:
- MiniServ 1.890 is vulnerable
- A working exploit is available in Metasploit

### Metasploit Module Used

use exploit/linux/http/webmin_backdoor

shell
Copy code

### Configuration

set RHOSTS 10.10.52.90
set RPORT 10000

shell
Copy code

### Execution

run

yaml
Copy code

---

## Initial Foothold 🖥️

Result:
- Exploit executed successfully
- Shell obtained **directly as root**

This means:
- No user-level access required
- No privilege escalation needed

The system was already fully compromised.

---

## Root Access 👑

With root access available immediately, the root flag was retrieved:

cat /root/root.txt

yaml
Copy code

✅ Root flag obtained

---

## User Flag Enumeration 👤

Since the shell was already running as root, the user flag was located manually:

find / -name user.txt 2>/dev/null
cat /path/to/user.txt

yaml
Copy code

✅ User flag obtained

---

## Summary 🏁

- Identified Webmin running on port 10000  
- Confirmed vulnerable MiniServ version  
- Used known Webmin RCE exploit  
- Gained immediate root shell  
- Retrieved both user and root flags  

No chaining. No escalation. Just clean exploitation.

---

## Key Takeaways 🧠📌

- Version enumeration is critical  
- Admin panels are prime attack targets  
- Outdated Webmin instances = instant compromise  
- Some boxes are won before privilege escalation even begins  
- Recon + exploit research beats brute force every time

## Final Words ☕

Source reinforces one brutal real-world truth:

> “If an admin panel is outdated and exposed,  
> the system is already lost.”

Easy box.  
Very realistic failure.
