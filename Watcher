# Watcher — TryHackMe (Medium) 👁️🧠🧩

Watcher doesn’t hide bugs.
It waits for you to **connect them**.

This box is all about **chaining**:
robots.txt → LFI → FTP → sudo → scripts → backups → root.

If you jump steps, you miss flags.
If you think methodically, it unfolds cleanly.

## Machine Overview 🖥️📌

Room Name: Watcher  
Operating System: Linux  
Difficulty: Medium  

Primary focus:
- Web enumeration & **robots.txt**
- **Local File Inclusion (LFI)** used correctly
- Service pivoting via **FTP**
- **Sudo misconfigurations**
- Script sourcing abuse
- Backup analysis leading to root

No kernel exploits.  
Just logic, trust issues, and bad ops hygiene.

## Reconnaissance 🔍

Initial port scan revealed three exposed services:

- 21/tcp  FTP 📁  
- 22/tcp  SSH 🔐  
- 80/tcp  HTTP 🌐  

With HTTP exposed, the attack path was clearly web-centric.

## Web Enumeration 🌐🧐

### robots.txt — Flag 1 🤖

The first hint pushed directly toward `robots.txt`.

Findings:
- A visible flag (**Flag 1**)
- A forbidden file: **secret.txt**

Direct access to `secret.txt` was blocked, but it was logged for later.
This wasn’t a dead end — it was a breadcrumb.

## Local File Inclusion (LFI) 📂🔓

Further enumeration identified a vulnerable parameter:
