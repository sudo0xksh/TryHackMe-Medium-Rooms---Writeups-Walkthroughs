# Boiler CTF — TryHackMe (Medium) 🧱🔥🧠

Boiler CTF is a Medium box built to test **discipline in enumeration**.

No rushing.  
No guesswork.  
Just layers of clues quietly asking one question:

> **“Did you enumerate properly?”**

---

## Machine Overview 🖥️📌

Machine Name: Boiler CTF  
Target IP: 10.10.xxx.xxx  
Operating System: Ubuntu-based Linux  

This machine focuses on:
- Relentless **service and content enumeration**
- Abusing **anonymous FTP for clues**
- Exploiting a **vulnerable web application**
- Escalating privileges via **misconfigured SUID binaries**

If you skip steps here, the box punishes you.

## Initial Reconnaissance 🔍

A full TCP scan was performed to map the attack surface.

nmap -sC -sV 10.10.xxx.xxx

Services discovered:

21/tcp     FTP      vsFTPd 3.0.3 (Anonymous login enabled) 📂  
80/tcp     HTTP     Apache 2.4.18 (Default page) 🌐  
10000/tcp  HTTP     MiniServ 1.930 (Webmin) ⚙️  
High port  SSH      Discovered during extended enumeration 🔐  

The mix of FTP, multiple web services, and Webmin made it clear:

👉 **This box will not fall without thorough enumeration.**

---

## FTP Enumeration 📂🧠

Anonymous FTP access was enabled.

Inside the FTP directory, a text file was discovered containing encoded content.

After decoding using **ROT13**, the message read:

> *“Just wanted to see if you find it.  
> Remember: Enumeration is the key!”*

Not subtle.  
Not optional.

---

## Web Enumeration (Port 80) 🌐🧐

The default Apache page showed nothing useful at first glance.

However, checking **robots.txt** revealed a long list of unusual paths:

/tmp  
/.ssh  
/yellow  
/not  
/a+rabbit  
/hole  
/or  
/is  
/it  

A provided hint stated:

> **“List & read, don’t reverse.”**

This suggested:
- Paths should be accessed **in order**
- No brute forcing or reversing logic

Manually visiting these paths revealed additional clues, including a long numeric sequence — reinforcing that the challenge was **layered** and intentional.

---

## CMS Identification 🧩

Further enumeration revealed the application was running **Joomla**.

Initial mistakes:
- Joomla was identified
- But not enumerated deeply enough

Correcting this oversight and expanding Joomla-specific enumeration uncovered a hidden directory:

👉 **_test**

This directory immediately became the primary attack vector.

---

## Initial Foothold via Web Exploitation 💥

Inside the `_test` directory, a vulnerable PHP endpoint was found.

By manipulating a URL parameter, arbitrary command execution was achieved:

index.php?plot=;cat log.txt

This allowed direct reading of server-side files.

Inside one of the logs:
- Valid username discovered
- Corresponding password recovered

The foothold was earned through patience, not force.

---

## Initial Access 🔓

Using the recovered credentials, SSH access was obtained.

Results:
- User-level shell established
- Initial foothold confirmed

Further enumeration inside the user’s home directory revealed:
- A backup script containing additional credentials

The `user.txt` flag was located inside a hidden directory and submitted.

---

## Privilege Escalation 🚀

Post-exploitation enumeration focused on binaries with SUID permissions.

A critical finding:
- **find** binary running with SUID

While `find` appears harmless, when misconfigured it can execute commands as root.

Using a standard **GTFOBins** technique:
- Root shell was spawned successfully

No kernel exploits.  
No race conditions.  
Just trusted binaries misused.

---

## Root Access 🏁👑

- Root privileges confirmed  
- root.txt flag retrieved  
- Full system compromise achieved  

Boiler CTF completed.

---

## Key Takeaways 🧠📌

- Enumeration beats exploitation when things feel “stuck”  
- Anonymous FTP often hides essential clues  
- robots.txt can act as a puzzle delivery mechanism  
- CMS-specific enumeration is non-negotiable  
- SUID binaries remain a reliable escalation vector
